Among them, it was undoubtedly a part of their education: and, in the opinion of Mr. Locke, it well deserves a {hare in ours. “ The writing of letters {fays this” great genius) enters for much into all the occasions of life, that no gentleman can avoid few- + ING himself compositions of this find. . A Crowe's"/newpage/"2 INTRODUCTION. - Occurrences will daily force him to"". | make this UFE of his pen: which lays open his breeding, his fences, and his | abilities, to a fevered examination than ° - any oral discourse.” . * Ir was quaint difference (fays Mr. | Hotel, in one of his epistles) that the ancients made betwixt a letter and an oration ; the one should be attired he a. Woman, and the other like a man. The oration 1s allowed large {aerobes, as long periods, parenthesis, similes, examples, and the parts of rhetorical flourishes ;. But a letter should be hard-coated, and closely couched. In short, we should write as we peak; and chats a true familiar letter which expreffech our mean- * ING the fame, as if we were discoursing. With the party to whom we write, in fun- CNET and easy terms. The tongue and pen are both interpreters of the mind; - but the pen the most faithful of the two; ~~ and as it has all the advantage of pre- - meditation, it is not for apt to err, and ""leave things behind on more authentic as well as Rafting record.” WHEN you fit down to write a letter, remember that this fort of writing (would be like conversation. Observe this, and you will be no more at a loss to write,, than you will be to [peak to the person I were i Ca"/newpage/"INTRODUCTION. 3 were he present; and thesis nature with-out affection, which, generally speaking  - always pleases. As to subjects, you are allowed in writing letters the utmost liberty; whatsoever has been done, or been, or heard, or thought of, your own observations on what you know, your’ inquiries about what you do not know, the time, the place, the weather, every thing about you stands 1eady for a pub- jet:and the more variety you intermix, - if not rudely thrown together, the bet-  - TER. Set discourses require a dignity OT -formality of style suitable to the pub- jet: whereas, letter-writing rejects all pomp of words, and is most agreeable when most familiar. But, though lofty frames are here improper, the file should hot be low and mean; and, to avoid it, let an easy complaisance, an open-sincerity, and unaffected good nature, appear in all you fay; for a fine letter does not confit in saying fine, things, but, in expressing ordinary ones with elegance and propriety ; for as to please while it informs, and charms e- Ven in giving advice.  Ir should also wear a honest, chair- full countenance, like one who truly esteems, and is glad to feel his friend; and not like a fop, admiring his own i Am 2 dress,"/newpage/"4 INTRODUCTION. Dress, and seemingly pleased with nothing but himself,) Express your meaning as freely as possible. Long periods may please the ""ear, by they perplex the understanding; a (short style and plain, strikes the mind and fixes an impression; a tedious one | is seldom clearly understood, and never "" long remembered. But there is fill something requisite beyond all this, to-) wards the writing of a polite and agreeable letter, and that is, an air of good breeding and humanity, which ought Yonatan- ' fly to appear in every expression, and, that will give a beauty to the whole. By this I would not be supposed to mean, overstrained or. AFF=led compliments, or anything that way tending; but an early, genteel, and obliging manner of L address, in a choice of words that bear _ the most civil meanings, with thorough generous, and good-natured disposition. For in familiar letters in the com-- Mon concerns of life, elegance is not required, nor is it the thing we ought to aim at: for, when tempted, the la- ©. Four is often been, and the end perverted by the very means. EAFE and clear- news are the only beauties we need to | Rudy. | Never"/newpage/"INTRODUCTION. 5 * Be Never in pain about familiarity IA the style to those'with whom you are acquainted; for that very pain will make it awkward and Riff, in spite of  . All your endeavors to the contrary.  Waste freely, but not hastily; let your words:drop from your pen, as they would from your tongue when peaking. Deliberately on a subject of which you are after, and Te a person with whom you are intimate. © Accustom yourself to think July, and you will not be at a loss to write clearly ; ‘for while there is confusion at the fountainhead, the brook will never be clear.  ¢ Before you begin to write, think what.

However, UN- necessary this caution may feet, I will:, venture to fay that ten appear riding-  Loss on paper, through hurry and want of thought, for one that is for through want of understanding.  A man that begins a speech before he is determined. Whit to fay, will UA- undoubtedly find himself bewildered before he gets to the end; not in Fanti- meet only, but in grammar. To avoid:  _ this, before you begin a sentence, have the whole of it in your head, and make UFE of the first words that offer them-"" -  . Ag’. elves"/newpage/"6 INTRODUCTION. Elves to express your.

But, of all things, learn to be correct, and never whitey careful perusal of what you have ~  Written, which, whoever neglects, must have many inaccuracies; and there are  Not only a reflection on the writer, but a rudeness to the person to whom they “are written. Never be ashamed of having found something amiss, which you confess that you did, by mending “it; for in that confession, you cancel the fault, and if you have no time to Tran- tribe it, let it pass; for a blot is by no means for bad as a blunder; and, by ac- coming yourself to core what is amiss, you will be left liable to future mistakes.  !
